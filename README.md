### Hi there, I'm Aditya ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) at work and learning functional programming constructs in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) during my free time. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on working through the book [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) or contributing to [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
