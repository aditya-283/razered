### Hi there, I'm Aditya 👋

I’m currently using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) at work and learning functional programming constructs in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) during my free time. I’m looking to collaborate on working through the book [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) or implementing new models in [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
