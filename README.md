### Hi there, I'm Aditya 👋

I'm a grad student at CMU currently and my coursework consists of deep learning, large-scale machine learning systems, and modern NN-based approaches in natural language processing.

Prior to coming to CMU, I worked at fast-paced startups as a software developer building fast, scalable, and extensible services using Django, Node, and Spring-Boot frameworks.

My hobbies include functional programming in Ocaml or Haskell and chess.
